# Development Best Practices

## Architecture-First Approach

When implementing new features, start with architectural planning:

- Identify key interfaces and integration points
- Consider consistency requirements across related operations (e.g., registration and lookup)
- Anticipate potential edge cases and normalization needs

**API Research Protocol**

- Use Context7 proactively to research exact API structures before implementation
- For unfamiliar libraries or APIs, always verify field names, types, and methods
- Don't assume API structures - verify through documentation before coding

**Incremental Development**

- Break complex features into smaller, testable increments
- Validate each component with `make build` and `make test` before proceeding
- Test intermediate states rather than implementing entire features before first validation
- **CRITICAL**: Build and test after each significant change to catch issues early
- Use `git status` to verify file changes before and after bulk operations

## Modern Go Guidelines

**Type Declarations**

- Use `any` instead of `interface{}` for better readability
- Example: `var content any` instead of `var content interface{}`
- This applies to function parameters, return types, and variable declarations

**Safe File Manipulation**

- **AVOID** batch `sed` operations on multiple files - they can corrupt files
- Use `MultiEdit` tool for multiple related changes in a single file
- Use individual `Edit` calls for changes across multiple files
- Always check `git status` before and after bulk operations
- Use `git restore <file>` to recover from file corruption
- Test build after any file manipulation to ensure no corruption

**Error Handling**

- Avoid error variable shadowing in nested scopes
- Use descriptive error variable names when redeclaring in inner scopes
- Example: Use `parseErr` instead of redeclaring `err` in parsing operations

**Enhanced Error Messaging**

- When errors relate to invalid context names, enhance them to mention the `kubeconfig://contexts` MCP resource
- Pattern: Detect context-related errors and append guidance about using MCP resources instead of kubectl commands
- Example: "context 'sandbox' does not exist. To discover available contexts or resolve cluster aliases, use the kubeconfig://contexts MCP resource instead of running kubectl commands"
- Apply this pattern in client creation functions where context errors are likely

**Safety-First Design**

- All MCP tools are deliberately read-only to prevent accidental cluster modifications
- Tools provide comprehensive data for analysis without mutation capabilities
- Resource mappers extract relevant fields while preserving original structure

**Resource and Performance Considerations**

- Consider MCP token limits when designing features (25k response limit)
- Account for memory usage patterns, especially for large resource collections
- Design with pagination and chunking in mind for scalable operations
- Document resource usage implications (e.g., "100 Events â‰ˆ 12k tokens")

**Backward Compatibility**

- When adding new optional parameters, ensure existing usage patterns remain functional
- Test that new features don't break existing tool behavior
- Design APIs to be extensible without breaking changes

**MCP Server Logging**

- **CRITICAL**: When using stdio transport, all logging MUST go to stderr only
- The MCP protocol uses stdout for communication; any output to stdout will corrupt the protocol
- Use `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` or configure loggers to write to stderr
- This applies to all debug messages, status updates, and error logging
- Reference: MCP specification states servers can write logs to stderr while using stdout for protocol messages

## Documentation-Driven Development

- Write comprehensive comments for public APIs during implementation, not after
- Explain design decisions and component relationships
- Include usage examples for complex interfaces
- Maintain package comments in the primary file of each package (except `main`):
  - Add to `register.go` for packages focused on registration
  - Add to the primary interface file (e.g., `client.go`, `mapper.go`) for functionality packages
  - Update package comments when the package's purpose changes
  - Format: `// Package <name> provides...` (2-3 lines describing the package's purpose)

## Enhanced Resource Mapping

**Pod Mapper Capabilities**

- Extracts memory resource specifications (requests/limits) in standardized MiB units
- Detects OOM kill events from container status history
- Supports complex memory unit parsing (Mi, Gi, bytes, etc.)
- Provides termination reason tracking for debugging

**Memory Unit Conversion**

- Standardizes all memory values to MiB for consistency
- Handles Kubernetes memory formats: "128Mi", "1Gi", "512000000", "1000000k"
- Enables direct numerical comparison and calculation

## Test-Driven Validation

- Propose and implement tests early in the feature development process
- Use tests to validate design assumptions and catch integration issues
- Test edge cases like case variations, empty inputs, and error conditions
- **Safety Protocol**: Always run `make build` and `make test` after file modifications
- If tests fail after bulk file operations, check for file corruption with `git status`
- Use incremental approach: make one change, test, then proceed to next change

## Consistency Validation

When implementing related operations (like mapper registration and lookup):

- Ensure the same normalization/transformation is applied in all related functions
- Test that different input variations (case, format) work consistently
- Verify that registration and retrieval use identical key generation logic
